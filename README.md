# MyReads Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project is a bookshelf web app that displays books based on the states:
read, currently reading, and want to read.  Books appear on the home page
and are arranged on shelves according to their current state.  The state can be
changed which results in the book moving to the appropriate shelf.  There is
also a search page that allows the user to search for and categorize books
listed in the search results.

The project was built using React and integrates with an API that provides
methods to get and update book information.
